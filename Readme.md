Instructions to run:
1.	Place the train.txt, test5.txt, test10.txt, test20.txt, train and test input files in same location as the python code.
2.	In the recommender.py code, go to the end of the file and uncomment the function call (line 438 - line 442) , for the algorithm you want to execute. Run only one function at once, as all algorithms are programmed to write output to the same file names â€“ named result5, result10, result20.
3.	Command to run on terminal: 
		$ python3 recommender.py
4.	Output file generated: 
		result5,result10,result20 files will be generated in the same path as the code file
